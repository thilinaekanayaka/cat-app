# Cat Card

## Motivation

Dear Software Engineer,
I have written an innovative new application! This uses Cat as a Service (https://cataas.com)
and does the following:

1. Fetches an image of a cat with some custom text
2. Fetches an image of another cat with some more custom text
3. Binds these images together into one image
4. Saves the resulting image as a file

But I need your help with a few things...
The Task
My coding skills are a bit rusty. Refactor my application to improve, harden and modernize
the code. Be prepared to verbally rationalize the changes you make.
Tips
Aim for,

- Simplicity (less is more!)
- Maintainability
- Performance

## Installation

Use npm to install the necessary packages.

```bash
npm install
```

## Running the app

```bash
npm start
```
